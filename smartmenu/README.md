# SmartMenu UI (starter)

1. Install
   - cd smartmenu
   - npm install

2. Run
   - npm run dev
   - Open http://localhost:5173

3. Notes
   - This is a minimal starter that mirrors the Figma layout structure (topbar, sidebar categories, menu grid).
   - To connect tools that require a Figma API key, set environment variable FIGMA_API_KEY before using tools that read it.
   - Continue implementing styling and components to match your Figma design tokens and interactions.
